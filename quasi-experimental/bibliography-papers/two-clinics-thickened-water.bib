abstract = {Abstract Background Thickened water has been widely used in patients with dysphagia who receive oral feeding, but there is little evidence for tube-feeding patients. Objective To explore the effects of thickened water swallow training in tube-feeding and dysphagia patients in the acute and early subacute phases of stroke. Methods A quasi-experimental study. Hospitalised patients with acute and early subacute stroke who received tube feeding due to dysphagia were recruited from March to December 2021. Patients assigned to the intervention group (n = 23) received thickened water swallow training three times daily until the feeding tube was removed or they were discharged, and patients in the control group (n = 23) received usual care. The main outcomes were duration of tube feeding and rates of weaning at discharge. Results Patients in the intervention group had a shorter tube-feeding duration (p = .046) and a higher rate of weaning at discharge (p = .017) than those in the control group. Significant interaction effects between time and group were detected regarding quality of life except for the swallowing burden dimension. Conclusions Thickened water swallow training is feasible and effective for stroke patients with tube feeding and can shorten the duration of tube feeding and improve the rates of weaning and quality of life. Healthcare providers in nonrehabilitation units should actively conduct swallowing function intervention training to maximise the potential for acute and early subacute phase rehabilitation.}
